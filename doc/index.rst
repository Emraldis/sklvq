Welcome to scikit-learning vector quantization's documentation!
===============================================================

Scikit-learning vector quantization (sklvq) is a scikit-learn compatible implementation of
some expandable Learning Vector Quantization algorithms. The main purpose is to make it easier to
compare results by providing a central point for the implementations of the LVQ algorithms.

Currently the package implements three algorithms from the LVQ family, all based on the
generalized learning objective, i.e., Generalized Learning Vector Quantization (GLVQ),
Generalized Matrix Learning Vector Quantization (GMLVQ) and Local Generalized Matrix Learning
Vector Quantization (LGMLVQ).

The package provides a number of different activation, discriminant, distance and solver methods.
