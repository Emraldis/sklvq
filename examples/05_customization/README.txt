Customization
=============

The algorithms accept custom activation, discriminant and distance functions, as well as solvers.
Any customization with proper testing and documentation will be considered to be included in the
sklvq package. Please, create a pull request on github.

Custom models and objectives are also welcome. However, as they greatly impact all currently
implemented  parts and even might work completely differently there is no easy way to make this
similarly expandable as what currently is.
